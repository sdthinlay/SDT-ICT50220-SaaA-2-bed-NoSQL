# How to Answer Questions

Each time you answer a question, fill out the space provided for the answer to the question.

```text
## Question X - Title

Query Solution:

```js
	db.collection_name.find();
	```
```

The NoSQL code used to answer the question is contained in a code block, as shown above. 

It is important that code blocks start at the beginning of the line for formatting on GitHub, Obsidian or your preferred IDE render the code correctly.

Images are embedded using the following syntax:

```markdown
![Short Image Title](./folder/filename.extension)
```

For example:

```markdown
![Embedding an Image Example](./assets/step-N-XXX.png)
```

Gives:
